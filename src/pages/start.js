            Your .eth name is the name of your Ethereum address. So instead of
            asking somebody to pay 0x1234..., they can just pay name.eth.
            It&apos;s like how before regular domain names, like nike.com, you
            had to enter an IP Address like 108.139.47.109

          But an ENS name is more than just a domain... Its a composable web3
          profile that follows you around web3 so that you don&apos;t have to
          re-enter the same profile settings on each website you visit.
        </Typography>
        <Typography as="p">
          For example, rainbow.me shows the same profile data for gregskril.eth
          that eth.xyz does. This is because these tools, along with thousands
          of others, respect your ENS profile.
